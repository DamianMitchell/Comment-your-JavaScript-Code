<p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.<br /> Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other<br /> people who will later need to figure out what that code does.</p>
<br />
<p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
<br />
<p>Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:</p>
<br />
<p>// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */:</p>

<p>/* This is a 
   multi-line comment */</p>
<p>Best Practice</p>
<p>As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify<br /> the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate<br /> the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and<br /> for your future self.</p>
<br />
<p>Instructions</p>
<p>Try creating one of each type of comment.</p>
</body>
<script>
//creating comments inside script can be use not only to 
//explain your code yet to also comment out code lines
//for example 

/*function comments(){
if(){
}
}
*/
//using a /* comment can comment out multi-lines of code
//just remember it's good to show how you think during youre lessons
